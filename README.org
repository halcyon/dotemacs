* Emacs Literate Config
** Description
This is my literate emacs config, I mainly code for the web so it leans heavily in that direction.

** How to use
The actual [[file:emacs.org::*Configuration][configuration]] is an org file
The [[file:init.el::(require%20'org)][init]] file simply calls this org file and evaluates the contents of the source blocks.
